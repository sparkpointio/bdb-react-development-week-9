# BDB React Development - Week 9 Final Exercise

For week 9 and your final exercise for this course, create a simple UI for Ropsten transactions. API will be provided in the instructions below. You may test using your address used earlier in the solidity course, making sure itâ€™s not an address with empty transactions, else you may get some drip of eth on https://faucet.ropsten.be/

_This only applies to students enrolled in **SparkPoint Academy's** [Blockchain Developer Bootcamp 2021](https://sparkpoint.io/bootcamp)_

## Setup
1. Fork this repository, and clone it on your end.
2. Run `npm install` to generate your `node_modules` folder and download all necessary packages.
3. Ask for the `.env` file from BDB Mentor,  [Harvz](https://github.com/harveyjavier) via Slack DM.
4. Upon receiving the `.env` file, place it in the root folder of the project. Then you can now use `process.env.REACT_APP_ROPSTEN_API_KEY`. This will call the API key from the .env file.
5. Here's the API you're going to use for Ropsten:
	- For ETH / normal transactions: `https://api-ropsten.etherscan.io/api?module=account&action=txlist&address=${address}&startblock=0&endblock=99999999&page=1&offset=10&sort="desc"&apikey=${process.env.REACT_APP_ROPSTEN_API_KEY}`
	- For ERC-20 token transactions: `https://api-ropsten.etherscan.io/api?module=account&action=tokentx&address=${address}&startblock=0&endblock=99999999&page=1&offset=10&sort="desc"&apikey=${process.env.REACT_APP_ROPSTEN_API_KEY}`

	_Default endpoint values were already provided except for the dynamic ones which are enclosed by `${}`._
6. You can either use `fetch()`, `axios`, or any other third-party API call libraries of your choice.
7. Once you've successfully fetched the API, return it on your console via `console.log()` to check the object properties.
9. Some jargons or confusions you may encounter with the returned object properties of the API:
	- `value` (_String_) - The value property by default is displayed in `gwei`. To convert it to `ether`, just divide it to `1e18`. 18 is the default and standard decimal place for ETH. Same as other ERC-20 tokens, but sometimes they have different decimals. Just double check the `tokenDecimal` property.

		Example:
	```
	let testGwei = "300000000000000000";
	let testEther = Number(testGwei) / 1e18 ;
	console.log(testEther); // output would be 0.3 in ether
	```
	_You'll learn more about this in the next course, Web3js._
	- `timestamp` (_String_) - A timestamp is a sequence of characters or encoded information identifying when a certain event occurred. To convert it to a readable date, use this basic JavaScript's `new Date().toISOString()` method. Make sure the timestamp being passed as argument in the Date function is a `number` data type.

		Example:
	```	
	let testTimestamp = "1628686135";
	let readableDate = new Date(Number(timestamp)).toISOString();
	console.log(readableDate); // output would be "1970-01-19T20:24:46.135Z"
	```
9. To run the project, make sure you're currently in your root folder of the project in your command line and run: `npm start`.
10. Apply all the things you've learned from Week 7 to 9, and create a beautiful UI for Ropsten transactions. Be creative, and happy coding!
